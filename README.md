# MedPath Guide — Live Website Source

This repository contains the corrected source code for the MedPath Guide website.

The current GitHub Pages website is:

<https://3abody-71.github.io/My-website/>

The older Manus preview link is not automatically updated when this GitHub repository changes. Use the GitHub Pages link above to view the version built from the `main` branch.

It includes the original country pathways, specialty explorer and detail pages, saved-profile interactions, USA and Germany deep-dive sections, hospital cards, styling, application configuration, and the white-page production fix.

## Run locally

Install Node.js 20 or newer, then run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

For a production build, run:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

## Media and deployment note

The app source uses permanent `/manus-storage/...` paths supplied by the Manus project storage proxy. The matching original visual files and GIFs are included in `media-source/` as a backup. For a non-Manus deployment, upload those assets to your own storage or place them in the host's public asset directory, then update the corresponding paths in the source files.

Do not commit `node_modules`, `dist`, `.env` files, API keys, passwords, or private deployment metadata.
